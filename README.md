# amplifire-midi-controller
A small Arduino project to develop a midi controller for the Atomic Amplifire guitar modelling amd effects pedal.
This code can be uploaded to an Arduino board (the Arduino Nano is perfect) which can then be connected to footswitches and an expression pedal to control patches and midi parameters on the Aromic Amplifire pedal via a midi connection to the nano.
